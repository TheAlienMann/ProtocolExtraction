## Protocol Extraction.

<br /><br /><br />

This whole repo is based on [Leo's article](https://holyswift.app/how-to-use-published-properties-inside-a-protocol-in-swiftui/) where he describes a challenge that he describes it as `You need to update a view state based on a protocol property.`

While reading the article, thinking to myelf, saying this can be done in a backword way, like what we do when we refactor a code base, plus Getting help From your IDE, which is one of the recommended ways/steps to follow while refactoring. Here, I did the same.

To better understand, you'd better off reading the `git history`, along with the comments that I have left. For that, an app like `SourceTree` or `Fork` would do best. :=)
